To integrate the new information, I suggest adding a brief description of Hyperliquid at the beginning, right after the title. Then, add the official links to the main website and the explorer in the next paragraph. This maintains the current structure of the README while providing essential information about Hyperliquid at the very top where it's most noticeable.
